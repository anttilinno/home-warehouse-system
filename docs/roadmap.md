## Phase 2

  - [x] Overdue loans: loans past due_date
- [ ] Approval pipeline for member role
  - Members' create/update/delete operations require owner/admin approval
  - Pending changes table: entity type, action, JSON payload, requester, status

  - Background sync for offline changes
  - Push notifications support
- [ ] Item photos
  - Upload photos for items

  - Progress events: rows processed, errors so far, completion
  - Import history/audit log per workspace
  - Email notification on import completion (optional)

## Phase 3

- [ ] MCP server for AI integration
  - Expose HWS operations as MCP tools
  - Search items, manage inventory, check loans via natural language
