**Coverage: 27/27 (100%)**

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Name | Status | Score |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| 18 | Fuzzy Search Infrastructure | PASSED | 6/6 |
| 19 | Barcode Scanning | PASSED | 7/7 |
| 20 | Mobile Navigation - FAB and Gestures | PASSED | 6/6 |
| 21 | Mobile Form Improvements | PASSED | 10/10 |

**All phases verified with 100% must-have coverage.**

## Cross-Phase Integration

| From | To | Connection | Status |
|------|-----|------------|--------|
| Phase 18 | Phase 19 | IndexedDB shared infrastructure | WIRED |
| Phase 19 | Phase 20 | FAB scan action -> /dashboard/scan | WIRED |
| Phase 20 | Phase 21 | FAB add-item action -> /dashboard/items/new | WIRED |

### Key Export Chains

**Offline Search Chain:**
```
header.tsx -> useGlobalSearch -> useOfflineSearch -> offlineGlobalSearch -> Fuse indices -> IndexedDB
```

**FAB -> Scan Chain:**
```
dashboard-shell.tsx -> useFABActions -> scan action -> router.push("/dashboard/scan") -> BarcodeScanner
```

**FAB -> Form Chain:**
```
dashboard-shell.tsx -> useFABActions -> add-item action -> router.push("/dashboard/items/new") -> CreateItemWizard
```

**Integration Score: 14/14 exports connected**

## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: Scan-to-Action Flow

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| User taps FAB | PASS |
| Scan action in menu | PASS |
| Navigate to /dashboard/scan | PASS |
| Camera opens | PASS |
| Barcode detected | PASS |
| IndexedDB lookup | PASS |
| Quick action menu shows | PASS |
| User taps action | PASS |

**Result: COMPLETE**

### Flow 2: FAB-to-Form Flow

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| User taps FAB | PASS |
| Add Item action | PASS |
| Navigate to /dashboard/items/new | PASS |
| CreateItemWizard loads | PASS |
| Draft loads from IndexedDB | PASS |
| Smart defaults pre-fill | PASS |
| Form auto-saves | PASS |
| User submits | PASS |

**Result: COMPLETE**

### Flow 3: Offline Search Flow

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| User opens search | PASS |
| Network status checked | PASS |
| If offline, use Fuse.js | PASS |
| Query IndexedDB | PASS |
| Merge pending mutations | PASS |
| Results displayed | PASS |
| User taps result | PASS |

**Result: COMPLETE**

**Flow Score: 3/3 flows complete**

## Tech Debt

Minor items deferred to future work (non-blocking):

### Phase 19: Barcode Scanning
- Move action shows "Coming soon" toast - move dialog planned for future phase
- Scanner page accessible only via FAB and direct URL (not in sidebar navigation)

### Phase 20: Mobile Navigation
- `SelectableListItem` and `useSelectionMode` exported but not integrated into existing list views (infrastructure ready for future use)

**Total: 3 minor items across 2 phases**

## Human Verification Required

Each phase verification report includes 5-8 human verification tests requiring physical device testing:

- **Phase 18:** Fuzzy search quality, offline mode switching, touch targets
- **Phase 19:** Camera scanning performance, flashlight toggle, iOS PWA camera persistence
- **Phase 20:** Haptic feedback on iOS, radial menu animation, screen reader accessibility
- **Phase 21:** Multi-step wizard flow, smart defaults, iOS keyboard handling

These are documented in the individual phase VERIFICATION.md files.

## Conclusion

The v1.3 Mobile UX Overhaul milestone is **READY FOR COMPLETION**.

- All 27 requirements satisfied
- All 4 phases verified with 100% must-have coverage
- Cross-phase integration fully wired
- 3 E2E flows verified complete
- Minor tech debt documented (non-blocking)
