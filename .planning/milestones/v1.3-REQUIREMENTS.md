## v1.3 Requirements

Requirements for Mobile UX Overhaul milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Scanning

- [x] **SCAN-01**: User can scan QR codes and barcodes (UPC/EAN/Code128) using device camera
- [x] **SCAN-02**: User receives visual, audio, and haptic feedback on successful scan
- [x] **SCAN-03**: User can toggle flashlight/torch for low-light scanning
- [x] **SCAN-04**: User sees scan history with recent scans and timestamps
- [x] **SCAN-05**: User can enter barcode manually when scanning fails
- [x] **SCAN-06**: User sees quick action menu after scanning an item (loan/move/view/repair)
- [x] **SCAN-07**: User sees "Item not found" with create option when scanning unknown code

### Search

- [x] **SRCH-01**: User sees search results as they type (instant, < 300ms)

- [x] **SRCH-03**: User sees autocomplete suggestions while typing (5-8 items)
- [x] **SRCH-04**: User sees recent searches on search focus
- [x] **SRCH-05**: Search touch targets are at least 44x44px
- [x] **SRCH-06**: User can search while offline (IndexedDB-backed fuzzy search)

### Quick Actions

- [x] **QACT-01**: User sees floating action button (FAB) on mobile screens
- [x] **QACT-02**: User can tap FAB to expand radial menu with 3-5 actions
- [x] **QACT-03**: User can quickly access scan, add item, and log loan from FAB
- [x] **QACT-04**: User receives haptic feedback when tapping FAB actions
- [x] **QACT-05**: FAB actions change based on current screen context
- [x] **QACT-06**: User can long-press list items to enter selection mode

### Forms

- [x] **FORM-01**: Forms show essential fields first with advanced fields in expandable sections

## Future Requirements

- **SRCH-F03**: Smart suggestions based on recent activity and low stock

### Quick Actions Enhancements

- **QACT-F02**: Customizable FAB action shortcuts per user

### Forms Enhancements

- **FORM-F01**: Multi-step wizard with progress indicator for complex forms
- **FORM-F02**: Barcode scan to populate form fields
- **FORM-F03**: Voice input for text fields

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Offline delete via scan | Conflict resolution too complex, data loss risk |
| Real-time collaborative scanning | Network required, out of offline-first scope |
| Hardware barcode scanner support | USB/Bluetooth scanners add complexity, camera sufficient |
| AR overlay for item location | High complexity, not core to mobile UX |
| NFC tag scanning | Limited device support, QR/barcode covers use cases |
