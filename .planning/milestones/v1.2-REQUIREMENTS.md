## Future Requirements

Deferred to subsequent milestones.

### Advanced Features

- **REPR-F1**: Preventive maintenance scheduling (calendar-based)
- **DECL-F1**: Seasonal awareness (don't suggest holiday items in January)
- **DECL-F2**: Estimated resale value lookup (eBay/marketplace integration)
- **PHOT-F1**: Batch reprocessing admin tool (regenerate all thumbnails)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Full CMMS work order system | Over-engineered for home use; MTBF, work order assignments add complexity without value |
| AI room scanning for declutter | Complex ML investment, privacy concerns; manual inventory is sufficient |
| Automatic disposal actions | Dangerous; user must explicitly decide to dispose items |
| Marketplace integration (auto-listing) | Scope creep, API complexity, liability |
| Real-time photo editor | Users have phone editors; out of scope for inventory app |
| Client-side thumbnail generation | Inconsistent results, battery drain; server-side is better |
